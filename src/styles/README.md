Example Pattern Library
=======================

When you are creating an actual styleguide your team needs to agree on the semantics (naming, structure, coding style) of how you will contruct your project. Different ways may suit different projects and teams. Whatever your preferences and decisions are, we recommend that you document your approach in the overview chapter (this one) of your style guide so everyone in the team has a shared opinion on how the markup and styles are constructed in the project.

In this tutorial we present one, strongly opinionated way of organising your project. The approach promoted here is inspired by the Philip Walton's essay "[CSS Architecture](http://philipwalton.com/articles/css-architecture/)", Brad Frost's "[Atomic web design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)" concept and [BEM](http://bem.info/) naming from Yandex. However, the tutorial does not attempt to be fully compliant with any one of these approaches.

You may wish to check the sites behind links above. Don't worry about them too much. We'll revisit it all in small chunks. Once you have taken a quick look at the sites, move on to the Atoms chapter and proceed to further chapters in numerical order.
