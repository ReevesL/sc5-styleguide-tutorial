This is an example/tutorial styleguide for learning the basics of styleguide driven development.

About the Tutorial
------------------

This tutorial should cover everything you need to try out style guide driven development. We take you through the steps of installing and running style guide, creating a semantic for your project and creating and documenting your styles. Ideally you should have your own project in the back of your head to reflect upon what you learn here but we will provide some ideas for people who want to take the course for the sake of learning.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started you need to install npm, clone this repository from github, type "npm install" on your command line and run gulp to start the styleguide. Once you have the SC5 styleguide running the tutorial will also be available to you as the overview chapter of the example styleguide that we will use to get through the basics.

Styleguide Basics
-----------------

The SC5 Styleguide reads your projects LESS/SASS/CSS files for KSS notation and hosts an interactive presentation of your styles and their intended uses. For the styleguide to be useful your styles need to be KSS annotated. The styleguide also expects you to provide the compiled CSS output for styling the elements when they are displayed to the user. This way you retain full control over the CSS compilation.

Semantics of Your Styleguide
----------------------------

When you are creating a styleguide your team needs to agree on how you will contruct your project. Different ways may suit different projects and teams. In this tutorial we familiarize ourselves with an approach inspired by the Philip Walton's essay "CSS Architecture", Brad Frost's "Atomic web design" concept and BEM naming from Yandex.
